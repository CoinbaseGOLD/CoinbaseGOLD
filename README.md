- 👋 Hi, I’m @CoinbaseGOLD
- 👀 I’m interested in the general public's views and implentations on Coinbase/GOLD network
- 🌱 I’m currently learning blockchain, smart contracts and decentralize applications
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on allowing the general public to suggest and make changes to the system without the project's team consent.
-     This could include applying updates to the network or system code that weren't supported or developed by the project team.
- 📫 How to reach me @game.fi.gold@gmail.com
